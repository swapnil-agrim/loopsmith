# hello-sdlc — a worked SDLC-kit walkthrough

A tiny project (`greeter.py` + `test_greeter.py`) with the SDLC kit already initialized
(`.sdlc/`), and one real goal queued: **add a `!` to the greeting**
([`.sdlc/goals/0001-add-exclaim.md`](.sdlc/goals/0001-add-exclaim.md)).

> The kit's SDLC phases lean on the **superpowers** companion plugin for phases 1/3/5/6/7
> (brainstorm → plan → implement → review → retro); plan-review is the kit's own
> `sdlc-plan-review`. Install superpowers for the full engine; without it the phase names still
> guide the work.

## Run it (interactive mode)
```
/sdlc-goal .sdlc/goals/0001-add-exclaim.md
```
You'll be walked through the goal one gate at a time (you approve each). At the end, `greet()`
returns `"Hello, x!"`, `test_greeter.py` passes, and the goal is recorded `done`.

## Run it (autonomous mode)
```
/sdlc-loop
```
Pulls the backlog and runs each pending goal unattended, parking anything that needs you to
`.sdlc/state/review-queue.md`. Then:
```
/sdlc-status
```
```
backlog: 0 pending, 0 in-progress, 1 done, 0 parked | iteration 1 | review-queue: empty
```

## Note on state in git
This example **commits** `.sdlc/state/` so it's self-contained and runnable as a reference. In your
own repo, add `.sdlc/state/` to `.gitignore` (per the tip `/sdlc-init` prints) — that state is
machine-written loop progress, not source.
