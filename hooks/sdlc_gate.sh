# Generic Goal-Based SDLC enforcement — INTENT-AWARE. Portable (LoopSmith).
# Wired as a UserPromptSubmit hook. Reads {"prompt": "..."} on stdin, classifies
# intent with deterministic regex (fast — no LLM), and injects an intent-tagged
# SDLC directive. Advisory: a false positive over-reminds; a false negative falls
# back to the standard policy. Always emits valid single-line JSON.
set -uo pipefail   # (no -e on purpose: the script MUST always reach the JSON emit; -e could abort early and drop the policy)

# Per-repo scoping: the SDLC directive belongs to repos that ADOPTED the spine
# (an .sdlc/ directory exists). In any other repo this hook is a silent no-op —
# a machine-wide plugin install must not inject policy into unrelated projects
# or fight a repo's own discipline. LOOPSMITH_GATE_GLOBAL=1 restores the
# pre-0.6 always-on behavior for anyone who relied on the universal reminder.
# Same guard pattern as research_capture.py (absent config == off, fail-open).

STD_MSG='GOAL-BASED SDLC — standing policy. For any non-trivial or implementation task, do NOT jump straight to coding; follow the flow and state which step you are on. (1) GOAL — restate the objective as one concrete goal (superpowers:brainstorming for feature/creative work). (2) RESEARCH — blast radius, affected files, existing patterns, constraints. (3) PLAN — write the plan (steps/files/tests/DoD) via superpowers:writing-plans. (4) PLAN-REVIEW — adversarially review the plan BEFORE implementing; never skip. (5) IMPLEMENT — superpowers:test-driven-development + executing-plans. (6) REVIEW — code-review + superpowers:verification-before-completion (evidence before claims). (7) RETROSPECTIVE — capture lessons. Issue hygiene: 1 type + >=1 component/area label; lock critical insights as you make them. Trivial, conversational, or read-only requests may be answered directly — but say so explicitly. Phase skills name the superpowers plugin (recommended companion); without it, the phase names still guide.'
