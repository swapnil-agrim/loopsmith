✅ loopsmith copied to: $DEST

To activate the SDLC hook, add this to ~/.claude/settings.json under "hooks"
(parse-check the file afterward — malformed JSON silently disables hooks):

  "UserPromptSubmit": [
    { "hooks": [
      { "type": "command",
        "command": "bash \"$DEST/hooks/sdlc_gate.sh\"",
        "statusMessage": "Applying goal-based SDLC policy" }
    ] }
  ]

Verify: echo '{"prompt":"x"}' | bash "$DEST/hooks/sdlc_gate.sh" | python3 -m json.tool
