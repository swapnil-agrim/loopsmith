"""One comment-watch tick: for every issue with a currently-open ledger claim, fetch its recent
comments and notify the claimant of anything new — reusing the existing `to`-addressed note + inbox
mechanism (ledger.append + watch_classify.classify), the same delivery #385 asks for, no new
channel.

Thin wiring, mirroring agent_watch.py's own shape: the only judgement here is "is this comment new"
(the per-issue cursor) and "is this comment worth notifying about" (comment author != claimant) —
everything else (who to notify, how it's delivered, exactly-once/dedup) is existing ledger/
watch_classify machinery. Off by default (`comment_watch.enabled`), and — like agent_watch.py —
only ever runs when the ledger is on and discovery is github (comments don't exist for local goal
files).

Two prerequisites, both already shipped, without which this feature cannot work at all:
- **#477** (`watch_classify.classify()`): a DELIBERATE self-addressed ledger note (`actor == me AND
  to == me`) used to be dropped by the own-write filter before it ever reached the signature check —
  exactly the shape this module writes in the normal solo/self-claimed deployment (actor=claimant,
  to=claimant, both resolved from THIS machine's own `ledger.actor`). Without #477, nothing this
  module writes would ever reach that claimant's own inbox.
- **This module's own `ref` fix to `watch_classify.signature()`** (see that function's docstring):
  without `ref` folded into the signature, every comment-notification for the SAME issue collides on
  an identical `kind:issue:state:priority` signature (kind="note", no state, a constant priority),
  and the signature set persists with no expiry — so the FIRST comment notification for an issue
  would permanently "use up" that signature and silently swallow every later, genuinely different
  comment on it, forever.
