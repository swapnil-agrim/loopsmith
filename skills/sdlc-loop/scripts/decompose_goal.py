decompose_check's own `file`-mode branch -- one feature's own home, not force-fit into the
classifier module it merely depends on (for the two body-marker constants, reused below so the
template's own worked examples can never drift from what the classifier's guard actually checks)."""

Decompose #{parent} into independently implementable sub-issues. This goal creates ISSUES only —
never implement any of #{parent}'s own work here.

## Step 0 — reconcile first (every check a DIRECT timeline read, never a search)

- #{parent} is already CLOSED -> obsolete: comment here saying so, run `loop.py verify`, `record
  done`, stop.
- #{parent}'s own comments already contain a "decomposed into ..." summary, OR this goal's own
  timeline (or a sibling decompose-goal's) already shows children created — each `handoff.py track`
  call posts its own narrative on the filing goal's timeline, and that narrative IS the child
  ledger -> already done: same exit.
- Another OPEN `sdlc:decompose` issue also targets #{parent} (list issues labelled `sdlc:decompose`,
  then read each candidate's first line for `{decompose_of}#{parent}`) with a LOWER issue number
  than this one -> defer to it: same exit. Lower-number-wins is the tie-break: without it, two
  concurrent duplicates each see the other and both abort (a mutual-abort deadlock) — the
  lowest-numbered open decompose-goal always proceeds, every other one defers.

## Step 1 — research

Research #{parent} fully: its title, body, and comments, and the code paths it actually touches.

## Step 2 — plan the split

Plan 2..{max_children} children, each independently implementable AND independently verifiable on
its own, each with a distinct, specific title. Add a dependency edge between two children only
where one genuinely cannot start before the other lands. Plan-review applies as normal to this
plan — the independent reviewer judges the split itself, not just this template's prose.

## Step 3 — implement: create each child (never `gh issue create` directly)

Create each child in dependency order (blockers first, so their issue numbers exist before a
sibling references them) via:

    handoff.py track <sdlc-dir> {parent} --area <#{parent}'s area> --why "<one line>" \\
        --queue actionable --assignee same-area --blocks no --priority <#{parent}'s priority> \\
        --label model:<predicted tier> --title "<child title>" --body-file <tmp>

Child body: FIRST line `<!-- {decomposed_from}#{parent} -->`; near the top a `Blocked by
#<sibling>` line for each real dependency; then the child's own content.

## Step 4 — verify (outcome-check)

Confirm every child appears in `gh issue list --label sdlc:goal --assignee <configured assignee>
--state open`; fix or `record parked` (saying exactly what failed) for anything missing or
unassigned. Comment on #{parent}: "decomposed into #A, #B, #C — see this goal for the plan." Run
`loop.py verify` before `record done`.

No code changes happen in this goal -> no worktree, no branch, no PR: skip `work.py` entirely and
record the outcome directly.
