"""Goal-size classifier — deterministic, zero-LLM detection of an oversized ("epic-shaped") goal
before the loop ever spends a token on it. Same shape as sdlc-model/scripts/predict.py (ordered
signals, first match wins, pure functions, module-constant thresholds), but a different axis: not
WHICH model a goal deserves, WHETHER a goal is actually several goals wearing one issue number.

Lives BESIDE loop.py (not under skills/sdlc-model/, despite the family resemblance to predict.py):
loop.py's own module loader (`_load()`, loop.py:26-28) resolves every sibling module from its OWN
directory only, so a classifier imported cross-skill would need a second loader — this repo's "one
_load() per script, same-directory only" convention deliberately does not have one.

v1 signals, in order (first hit wins): body length (word count, then line count) -> independent
`## ` sections -> top-level checkboxes -> explicit multi-phase structure.

CALIBRATION PROVENANCE (#520): the four thresholds below are fit against THIS repo's own issue
history — 269 issues measured on 2026-08-08 — not picked in the abstract, and checked in BOTH
directions, not just tuned to catch positives:

  - WORD_THRESHOLD=1200: the corpus's largest genuine (non-epic) goal is #522 at 801 words
    (goal p99=639); 1200 clears it with real margin instead of hugging the observed max.
  - LINE_THRESHOLD=150: unchanged — no corpus evidence required retuning it.
  - SECTION_THRESHOLD=6: the fence-stripped corpus's largest genuine goal tops out at 5
    independent `## ` sections. The old value of 3 produced 32 flags out of 74 issues checked, with
    ZERO true positives among them — every one was a conventionally-shaped Context/Scope/AC/
    Verification goal (the #519/#520/#521 shape), never an actual epic.
  - CHECKBOX_THRESHOLD=4: unchanged, and deliberately so — it is the ONLY signal with any true
    positive in this corpus. Lowering it to 3 would catch one more real epic (#156) at the cost of
    34 additional false positives measured across the corpus; see the known-miss note in
    tests/test_goal_size_corpus.py for the full arithmetic. #156 stays a documented, accepted miss.

These numbers are fit to ONE repo's history and ship as the plugin's defaults regardless — an
adopting repo's own issue conventions may differ, which is why the config template
(skills/sdlc-init/templates/config.json.tmpl's `_goal_decompose` explainer) still recommends
`mode: log` as the first rung for a NEW adopter: log mode surfaces what the classifier would have
flagged, on that repo's own real goals, before anything ever acts on it.

ponytail: same as predict.py's — a known-coarse heuristic with an explicit, versioned upgrade path
(retune the constants, or replace with a corpus-fit model) rather than an LLM call on this path,
which must stay zero-latency, zero-cost, and hermetically testable."""

# oversized), AND by backlog_check.py's dedup exemption (#521: a marked goal is exempt from the
# confident duplicate/obsoleted-by/in-flight-similarity findings -- never from an explicit blocker or
# a recorded hand-off). Both read these constants instead of retyping the literal, so the two checks

    Tracks the OPENING delimiter CHARACTER and closes only on a matching run — CommonMark: a fence
    closes only on a delimiter of the same character (and at least the same length; length isn't
    modeled here, only the character is, since every delimiter this regex matches is exactly three
    chars). A ~~~ line inside an open ``` fence is ordinary fenced CONTENT, not a close, and vice
    versa — the earlier version toggled on ANY fence-look-alike regardless of character: a

    structure — a bug that failed TOWARD flagging, never away from it (pinned by
