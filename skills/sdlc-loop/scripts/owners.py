"""Who owns what, read from the repo's own CODEOWNERS.

A team already declares ownership once, in `.github/CODEOWNERS`, and the host enforces it on every
PR — so that file is the roster. Reading it beats a second list in config.json, which would be one
more thing to keep true.

Matching follows GitHub's rule: patterns are tried in order and **the last one that matches wins**.
The glob subset supported here is the one CODEOWNERS files actually use — `*`, `/dir/`, `dir/`,
`*.ext`, and `**` — not the whole gitignore grammar. An unmatched path simply has no owner, which
callers must treat as "nobody in particular", never as an error. Zero deps.
