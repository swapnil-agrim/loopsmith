issues labelled `sdlc:goal` — the SDLC is identical either way, so a phase that only knows how to
record itself to the filesystem silently loses its audit trail for every github-mode team.

These pin the mode-aware seams of the phases added on top of the original seven. The failure they
guard is quiet by nature: nothing errors, the work just becomes invisible to everyone not sitting at
