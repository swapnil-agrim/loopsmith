"""goal_decompose 8b (#520): two-direction corpus validation of `goal_size.classify` against
CHECKED-IN real-issue fixtures — never live `gh` fetches at test time (`verify.command` gates every
future goal's `done`, so a GitHub outage must not be able to refuse the whole backlog).

CALIBRATION PROVENANCE: the fixtures below were harvested once, at implementation time
(`gh issue view N --json body -q .body`, 2026-08-08), from this repo's own issue history — the same
269-issue corpus whose measurement retuned the constants in `goal_size.py` (see that module's own
docstring for the full both-direction margins). This file is the checked-in PROOF subset, not the
full 269 — small enough to read, large enough that a classifier which flags everything or nothing
fails loudly, naming the offending fixture.

THREE DIRECTIONS: POSITIVES (real epics, must flag), NEGATIVES (real small/conventionally-shaped
goals, must NOT flag), and a third direction, STUBS (#287-#294) — thin tracking-issue bodies that
must also NOT flag, but for a DIFFERENT reason than the negatives: they are exempted by this repo's
OWN label scheme (`epic` + deliberately not `sdlc:goal`), never reaching the loop's pick path at
all — not by anything the classifier itself detects. The classifier has no signal that could tell a
genuinely tiny goal from a tiny tracking stub; it isn't asked to. This direction pins that real
limit instead of asserting something the classifier structurally cannot do.

RECALL HONESTY: in this corpus, only the checkbox signal (signal 3) produces a true positive — all
9 real epics below are flagged via checkboxes, never via word count, line count, sections, or phase
structure alone. Those other four signals are validated here for PRECISION only (they correctly
stay silent across every negative and every stub); nothing in this corpus proves any of them can,
by itself, catch a real epic.

KNOWN MISS (#156): a real epic with only 3 top-level checkboxes — one under CHECKBOX_THRESHOLD=4 —
is NOT flagged by this classifier, and is deliberately not in the POSITIVES list below (it would
fail). Lowering CHECKBOX_THRESHOLD to 3 would catch it, at a measured cost of 34 additional false
positives across the 269-issue corpus. One true positive for thirty-four false ones was judged a
bad trade; #156 stays a documented, accepted miss rather than a silently-passing assumption.

No conftest.py in this repo (tests/test_import_boundary.py's own docstring records why) — `_mod()`
below is copied from tests/test_decompose_check.py:17-19, same as every other test file here.
Fixture loading mirrors the insight subproject's `Path(__file__).parent / "fixtures"` convention
(insight/tests/test_metric_severity_rank.py:56) — the only on-disk fixture pattern already in this
repo — but only the PATH SHAPE is borrowed; insight/ itself is never imported from here
(tests/test_import_boundary.py forbids it, and this file doesn't need it)."""
