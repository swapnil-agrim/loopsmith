"""Both directions of the plugin/product import boundary, enforced (spec §1.1 rule 1, issue #97).

skills/ and hooks/ are the plugin; insight/ is the product. Neither may `import` the other as a
Python package — THE ALLOWED COUPLING IS FILE FORMATS ONLY. insight/ingest is specified to read
ledger/*/*.jsonl, goal frontmatter, config.json and state/* straight off disk (see the design
spec's §1.1 and ledger.py's own "an older reader ignores a field it does not know" contract):
reading a path is fine, `import insight` / `import skills` / `import hooks` is not.

WHY AST, NOT TEXT. Grepping for the substring "import insight" would false-positive on this very
sentence — this docstring is prose, never an import statement — and would false-negative on `import
insight as ins` or `import os, insight, sys`. (A repo-wide grep, unlike this checker, would also
trip on test_self_contained.py's legitimate comment mentioning "insight" in prose — the brief for
this file calls that out by name — but this guard itself never walks tests/, only skills/, hooks/,
and insight/, so that file was never actually at risk from THIS checker specifically.) So this
checker parses every file with `ast` and inspects only `ast.Import`/`ast.ImportFrom` nodes: real
import statements, never comments or docstrings. Verified empirically (not assumed): a docstring
plus a commented-out `# from insight import x` produces zero Import/ImportFrom nodes — see
test_ignores_comment_and_docstring_mentions.

WHAT COUNTS AS A MATCH. `import insight`, `import insight.ingest`, `import insight.ingest as ii`
(Import) and `from insight import x`, `from insight.ingest import y` (ImportFrom) are all caught by
comparing the dotted target's FIRST segment — `"insight.ingest".split(".", 1)[0] == "insight"` —
against the banned name. An `as`-alias only renames the LOCAL binding, never the thing imported, so
it needs no separate handling. A merely similarly-named module (`insightful`, `skills_extra`) is
NOT caught, because the comparison is exact-segment, not substring/prefix — see
test_does_not_flag_a_module_whose_name_merely_starts_with_the_banned_name.

ONLY ABSOLUTE IMPORTS COUNT (`ImportFrom.level == 0`). `from . import x` and even `from .insight
import x` (level=1, module=="insight", confirmed via ast.dump) resolve a name INSIDE the current
package, never the top-level package of the same name, so they can never cross this boundary no
matter what text follows the dots — see test_ignores_relative_import_named_like_the_banned_module.
An import is matched only by the actual absolute target of a real import statement, first segment,
exact — never a substring, and never a directory name. (The directory SKIP is a separate mechanism
from import matching; see THE DIRECTORY SKIP below for exactly what it does and does not exclude by
name — it is not all structural, and saying otherwise would be the exact false claim
tests/test_licence_boundary.py's own docstring records shipping and having to correct.)

DYNAMIC IMPORTS — `importlib.import_module("insight")`, `__import__("insight")` — ARE DELIBERATELY
NOT COVERED. Both take an arbitrary expression as their argument in the general case (a variable, a
built-up string, a config value); a check that only catches the literal-string special case would
miss the general one while advertising coverage it doesn't have. The literal case is also the least
likely form of accidental coupling — nobody reaches for `importlib.import_module("insight")` by
accident when plain `import insight` already does the job and IS caught here. Staying scoped to
`ast.Import`/`ast.ImportFrom` also keeps this checker structurally clear of
skills/sdlc-loop/scripts/*.py's legitimate, unrelated `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(name,
path)` calls, used to load SIBLING scripts by file path rather than by package name (discovery.py,
handoff.py, loop.py, sources.py, state.py, sync.py, watch.py, work.py all do this today) — that
call produces no Import/ImportFrom node at all, so it is never a special case this guard has to
carve out; see test_ignores_the_spec_from_file_location_sibling_loading_pattern, and, against the
real tree, test_skills_and_hooks_do_not_import_insight passing today.

THE DIRECTORY SKIP, THE SAME APPROACH AS tests/test_licence_boundary.py — worth being exact about
which part is which. That file's module docstring records two holes a near-identical guard shipped:
a name-based skip (`env`/`build`/`dist`, at any depth — also plausible module names) and a
`.gitignore`-based skip (which only relocated the same name heuristic). Its fix, mirrored here, is
exactly ONE structural (content-based) exclusion — a directory IS a virtualenv only if it carries
BOTH `pyvenv.cfg` and a `bin/`/`Scripts/` launcher dir, both required, so one planted `pyvenv.cfg`
can't veto a real module (`_is_virtualenv`) — plus TWO exclusions that ARE by name: `__pycache__`
and anything ending `.egg-info`. Those two are safe to match by name, unlike `env`/`build`/`dist`,
because neither is a plausible module name: `__pycache__` is RESERVED by CPython (PEP 3147 writes
bytecode there) and the dot in `*.egg-info` makes it unimportable as a Python package — and both are
gitignored at the repo root, so their contents cannot be committed without `git add -f`. Do not
extend this by-name list to a merely conventional name (`node_modules`, `.tox`) without checking
both halves first — reserved-or-unimportable, AND gitignored.

This logic is reimplemented here (`_is_virtualenv`, `_owned_py_files`) rather than imported from
tests/test_licence_boundary.py, and the real reason is narrower than "every guard file defines its
own helpers": this repo has no shared test-helper module to import from (no conftest.py, and no
test file imports another's functions — checked directly, not assumed). tests/test_licence_boundary.py
factors its scan into named helpers the same way this file does; tests/test_self_contained.py does
NOT — it inlines its scan directly in the test bodies and deliberately shares a module-level
SKIP_DIRS constant instead, precisely so its own pinning test reads the SAME object the scan uses
(see that file's comment: a private copy in an earlier version "pinned nothing at all"). So
test_self_contained.py is not a second example of "defines its own scan helpers" — it demonstrates
the opposite convention, inlining the scan and sharing a constant — and citing it as such would
misstate the very convention it demonstrates.

test_modules_named_like_build_trees_are_still_checked and
test_a_lone_pyvenv_cfg_cannot_hide_a_module below pin the same two holes shut for THIS checker, on
planted fixtures, so the coverage does not depend on skills/hooks/insight happening to contain a
build/dist/env directory today.

MESSAGES ARE SORTED, NEVER A RAW SET. A violation's hit names are joined via
`", ".join(sorted(hits))`, never an f-string over the set directly: CPython randomizes string
hashing per process (confirmed here — `set(["insight", "skills", "hooks", ...])` printed in three
different orders across three separate `python3 -c` invocations), so an unsorted join would make
failure messages, and any test asserting on them, flaky across runs.

NON-VACUOUS BY CONSTRUCTION. skills/ and hooks/ already carry real .py files today, so
test_skills_and_hooks_do_not_import_insight has live coverage; insight/ has few by comparison
(#95's package skeleton), so — matching the pattern test_licence_boundary.py settled on — the
checker is factored into a pure function (`_boundary_violations`) and proven against planted
tmp_path fixtures for BOTH directions, so its correctness never depends on what either tree
currently contains. The tree tests themselves also assert `_owned_py_files` is non-empty for every
root they scan, so a renamed or emptied skills/, hooks/, or insight/ fails loudly instead of passing
with zero signal — `_boundary_violations(Path("/does/not/exist"), ...)` returns `[]`, not an error.

KNOWN RESIDUE, stated so nobody mistakes this for airtight (mirrors test_licence_boundary.py's own
note — checked directly for this file, not assumed true by similarity): `rglob` does not follow
symlinked directories, so `insight/core -> ../src` would hide that tree from this guard; and
planting BOTH a `pyvenv.cfg` and a `bin/` inside a real module still silences it — the same
mechanism that makes the legitimate case work at all (test_a_real_virtualenv_is_skipped below),
verified directly against this file's own `_boundary_violations` rather than assumed from
tests/test_licence_boundary.py's note. Both are two-artifact, diff-visible moves — the veto this
guard closed was a one-file one.

A further residue specific to this checker: `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location` (see DYNAMIC
IMPORTS above) is out of scope everywhere, including ACROSS the plugin/product boundary itself. That
paragraph credits the call as legitimate sibling-loading inside skills/sdlc-loop/scripts/ — true
there — but a future insight/ingest/*.py could use the identical call to load, say,
skills/sdlc-loop/scripts/frontmatter.py by file path, and this guard would not flag it: the call
produces no Import/ImportFrom node regardless of which side of the boundary its target file sits on.
That IS the code coupling spec §1.1 rule 1 forbids. This guard does not attempt to detect it.

A THIRD residue, named here because this file is the AST guard and TypeScript cannot be parsed by
it: `.ts`/`.tsx` under insight/api/ and insight/web/ get no import-boundary check at all from this
file — `ast.parse` cannot read them, and no regex scanner is built here (issue #296 deliberately
stops short of one; a regex import-matcher for TS is real tooling, not five lines, and untested
tooling is worse than an honest gap). tests/test_licence_boundary.py's `.ts`/`.tsx` marker
convention proves the WALK reaches insight/api/ and insight/web/; it says nothing about what those
files import. E17.S1, once ESLint and real TS source exist, owns this residue — that story gets a
real parser (the TS compiler API or an ESLint rule) for free, at the point there is something real
to point it at.
