"""Issue-creation call-site guard (#462): `GitHubSource.create_dependency` must stay the ONE real
place this repo ever runs `gh issue create` — every non-comment issue this codebase creates on its
own behalf goes through it (via `handoff.create_tracked_issue`), so it stays labeled and assigned
instead of orphaned. A future call site that opens an issue some OTHER way (a second, divergent
implementation) is exactly the hardened-sibling-divergence pattern this repo's own retrospectives
keep flagging (the alignment-collect `+++`-misparse leak and its unfixed risk-detect.sh twin are the
canonical example) — this guard exists so that shape can't quietly reappear here.

WHY AST, NOT REGEX — the identical argument tests/test_import_boundary.py's own docstring makes for
a different guard ("Grepping for the substring ... would false-positive on this very sentence"):
`skills/sdlc-init/scripts/sdlc_init.py:196` prints a human-facing instruction telling an operator to
run `gh issue create --label sdlc:goal ...` by hand during `sdlc-init --github --demo` setup — a
plain `ast.Constant` string argument to `print()`, never a `List`/`Tuple` literal (confirmed by
inspection, not assumed — see test_ignores_prose_mentions_of_issue_create below, which plants the
same shape as a fixture). A substring/regex scan over that file's text would false-positive on it. So
this checker parses every file with `ast` and only ever inspects real `ast.List`/`ast.Tuple` literal
nodes — a comment, docstring, or plain string constant produces none, regardless of what text it
contains.

WHAT COUNTS AS A MATCH. The one real call site (`sources.py:347`, inside
`GitHubSource.create_dependency`) builds `args = ["issue", "create", *self._repo_args(), ...]` and
runs it via `self._run(args)` (which itself prepends the `gh` binary — never part of this literal
list). So a match is: an `ast.List` or `ast.Tuple` node whose first two elements are both
`ast.Constant` string literals, `.value == "issue"` then `.value == "create"`, in that order — the
exact literal shape the real site uses today. The enclosing `FunctionDef`/`ClassDef` is tracked via a
simple stack-based visitor (the same technique tests/test_vocabulary_coverage.py already uses for its
own Call-node scan), so a match can be reported as "which function, in which class" and checked
against the allowlist below.

ALLOWLIST — exactly one entry: `skills/sdlc-loop/scripts/sources.py`, class `GitHubSource`, method
`create_dependency` — the helper's own internal call. Anything else that matches is a violation.

NAMED LIMITATION, stated rather than silently assumed away (matching this repo's own established
documentation style — see tests/test_vocabulary_coverage.py's "NAMED LIMITATION" passage and
tests/test_import_boundary.py's "DYNAMIC IMPORTS ... ARE DELIBERATELY NOT COVERED" passage for the
same move applied to their own guards): this catches a literal `["issue", "create", ...]`
construction, the shape every real call site in this codebase uses today (confirmed by the plan's own
exhaustive call-site audit, loopsmith-core-changes-plan.md section 7). A future call site that builds
its args list through a helper function, string concatenation, or `*`-unpacking from a variable would
evade this specific check. Scoped honestly, not oversold.

SCOPE: every `.py` file under `skills/` and `hooks/` — not `insight/`, which contains no
issue-creation code of any kind (confirmed by the same call-site audit), so including it would just
be dead scope, unlike test_import_boundary.py's own guard which genuinely needs `insight/` for its
different purpose. Reuses test_import_boundary.py's own directory-skip logic (`__pycache__`,
`*.egg-info`, and the content-based `_is_virtualenv` check) rather than reimplementing a weaker
name-based one — this repo's own established lesson (stated explicitly in that file's docstring) is
that a name-based skip has already shipped bugs twice. Re-typed here rather than imported, for the
same reason tests/test_import_boundary.py gives for reimplementing it instead of
tests/test_licence_boundary.py's identical helper: this repo has no shared test-helper module (no
conftest.py, and no test file imports another's functions).
