"""Lane routing: the Research phase sizes a goal small/medium/large, and the orchestrators must
actually ROUTE on it. A lane that is computed and then ignored is the defect these pin — the goal
carries a size nobody reads, and a typo fix earns the same seven-phase pass as a schema migration.

The resolver is tested by behavior; the routing itself lives in the orchestrators' phase steps (which
are prose, like every other phase in this kit), so those are pinned structurally."""
